# Vector-Valued Image Regularization with PDEs

> This project implements vector-valued image regularization technique using PDE's as described in the paper - [Vector-Valued Image Regularization with PDEs: A Common Framework for Different Applications](https://tschumperle.users.greyc.fr/publications/tschumperle_pami05.pdf) by David Tschumperle and Rachid Deriche

A detailed report on methods and results can be found as [report.pdf](/docs/report.pdf). It was made as the final project for CS 663 - **Digital Image Processing** course in Autumn 2018 at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay, India.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Run `/src/inpainting.m` file for image inpainting, `/src/denoising.m` file for image denoising and `/src/flowVisualisation.m` file for flow visualisation.
2. Replace the arguments of the functions with respective input image paths and set the hyperparameters you wish to use to generate the output images.
3. The tuned hyperparameters for our output images can be found in `/src/main.m` file.

## Results

### Image Inpainting


### Image Denoising


### Image Magnification


### Flow Visualisation


### Image Restoration
